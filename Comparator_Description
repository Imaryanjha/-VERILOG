# 4-Bit Comparator Design

## Overview
A 4-bit digital comparator that compares two 4-bit inputs A and B, and produces three outputs: A > B, A < B, A == B.

## Features
- Compares two 4-bit numbers
- Three output signals: A_gt_B, A_lt_B, A_eq_B
- Combinational logic design

## Design
- **Technology:** Verilog
- **Type:** Combinational circuit
- **Inputs:** Two 4-bit numbers (A, B)
- **Outputs:** Three 1-bit comparison results
